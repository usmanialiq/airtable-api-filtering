### Important Note:
IMPORTANT: Thereâ€™s a requirement that is not mentioned in the video. You should only make 3 API calls to Airtable when a user logs in. This means your app must only make one API call to fetch the class records. You must use filterByFormula to fetch all the classes at once. The same is true for fetching the names of the students within the classes. Submissions that make more than 3 API calls per login will be disqualified.
